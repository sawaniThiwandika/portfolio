      A computer is a programmable electronic device that processes data to
      perform various tasks. It consists of hardware and software components working together
      to execute instructions and manipulate data. The basic components of a computer include a
      central processing unit (CPU), memory (RAM), storage devices (such as hard drives or SSDs),
      input devices (like keyboards and mice), output devices (such as monitors and printers),
      and a system bus that facilitates communication between these components.A computer is a programmable electronic device that processes data to
